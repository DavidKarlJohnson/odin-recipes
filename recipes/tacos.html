        <div class="ingredients-steps">
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound cod fillets, cut into 2 to 3 ounce portions</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
                <li>1 (12 ounce) package corn tortillas</li>
                <li>1/2 medium head cabbage, finely shredded</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Make beer batter: Combine flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Blend beer and egg in a separate bowl, then quickly stir into flour mixture until combined with a few lumps remaining.</li>
                <li>Make white sauce: Mix together yogurt and mayonnaise in a medium bowl. Gradually stir in fresh lime juice until consistency is slightly runny. Season with jalapeño, capers, cayenne, oregano, cumin, and dill.</li>
                <li>Start fish tacos: Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Dust fish pieces lightly with flour. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Dip floured fish pieces into beer batter. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Fry in hot oil until crisp and golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Lightly fry tortillas in hot oil until just crisped, but not too crisp. Drain on paper towels.</li>
                <li>Place fried fish in tortillas; top with shredded cabbage and white sauce.</li>
            </ol>
